# Natural Language Processing with Recurrent Neural Networks

## Project Overview

This project explores Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to perform tasks like sentiment analysis and character generation. Utilizing the power of RNNs, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, we analyze sequential data such as text for meaningful patterns and predictions.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classify the sentiment of movie reviews as positive or negative using the IMDB dataset.
- **Character Generation**: Generate text in the style of a given source, learning from character sequences to predict the next character in a sequence.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks)
